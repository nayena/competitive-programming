# Competitive Programming

This is intended to be a central location to store all code I've written to be used in any form of
competitive programming, for sites like: kattis, hackerrank, adventofcode, leetcode and friends.

I don't use Go at work, but I enjoy its syntax for competitive programming.

I don't have a degree in CS and have therefore not learned about algorithms and data structures in lectures, so this is
my attempt at trying to be structured in my approach.

# Advent of Code
Advent of code is a yearly returning event, where two problems are released daily, in the style of an [Advent Calandar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar).

The difficulty increases as the days go on and only 5% of those who begin the calendar, end up finishing it with all 50 problems solved.

According to the creator, there are only a _"couple hundred people in the world"_, who have completed all the years.
He did [an interesting talk at spotify TECH bytes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Cw7dtMUyKA), where he talks about the challenges running it. 

# Leetcode
Leetcode is a site that has a few thousand coding problems, ranked in three difficulties.
These are easy, medium and hard. Leetcode attaches tags to the problems you are working on,
indicating which technique you are meant to use.

Initially I use [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/) to guide me, in terms of which problems to
solve, to be effective in my learning. The NeetCode list contains 150 problems and it also
contains the "Blind 75" list, which is more carefully selected problems to do. Once done with those,
the author of "Blind 75", made a new list called ["Grind 75"](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75), which contains 75 (or up to 169) problems,
that aid additionally in learning the techniques/topics.

Lastly, I will use a site created by [Sean Prashad](https://github.com/seanprashad), called [LeetCode Patterns](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/) to ensure I have touched all important topics.

# Inspiration

The amount of information available for studying CS and concepts that we use in our daily work is quite frankly overwhelming.

I use below resources as inspiration for what I select to work on:
