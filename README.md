# Competitive Programming

This is intended to be a central location to store all code I've written to be used in any form of
competitive programming, for sites like: kattis, hackerrank, adventofcode, leetcode and friends.

I don't use Go at work, but I enjoy its syntax for competitive programming.

I don't have a degree in CS and have therefore not learned about algorithms and data structures in lectures, so this is
my attempt at trying to be structured in my approach.

# Advent of Code
Advent of code is a yearly returning, where two problems are released in the style of an [Advent Calandar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar).

The difficulty increases as the days go on and only 5% of those who begin the calendar, end up finishing it with all 50 problems solved.

According to the creator, there are only a _"couple hundred people in the world"_, who have completed all the years.
He did [an interesting talk at spotify TECH bytes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Cw7dtMUyKA), where he talks about the challenges running it. 

# Inspiration

The amount of information available for studying CS and concepts that we use in our daily work is quite frankly overwhelming.

I use below resources as inspiration for what I select to work on:
